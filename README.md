# Pengout - A mobile app to find events and friends
  Pengout will be a social mobile based application in which motivates people to attend different events and gain various and fun life experiences. The main point of our application is helping people socialize before going to each event. That is, each user will receive suggestions of events based on their interests and suggestions of different people going to the same event before attending. The app will basically detect people that share similar interests or had been in similar events before and match them. Communicating with the suggested users is completely on the users. They can send messages to each other and schedule a meeting or agree on attending the meeting together and they can add each other as friends. 

  Additionally, each user will have his/her own schedule of events. So when two users have the same gaps in their schedules that match an event the application will suggest both of them to attend the event together. If a user want to attend an event with a person s/he already knows, users can choose a second way. Users will be able to see the events where their friends attending or for a specific event which friends are attending, and users will be notificated. We also considered the case in which a user has a ticket for an event but he/she cannot attend for some reasons. In that case, the users will be able to hand over their tickets. This will also help people that want to attend the event but cannot find tickets. In this application users will also be able to create their own events and invite their friends and/or other users. The events created by the users will be saved in their personal calendar and be suggested to other users in case it matches their calendars as well. So that the event will be suggested to more and more people. Finally users will be able to check the reviews of some events and gain a background about that event before attending it.
